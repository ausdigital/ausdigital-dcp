## DBC Digital Capability Publisher (DCP) Specification

 * ![raw](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/raw.svg)
 * Editor: Chris Gough
 * Contributors: Steve Capell

This document describes a standard service for discovering the integration surface of a
participant in RESTful business-to-business message exchange.

This specification aims to support the Australian Digital Business Council e-Invoicing
initiative, and is under active development at http://ausdigital.org/.


##Glossary:

phrase | Definition
------------ | -------------
ausdigital-dcp/1 | This specification.
ausdigital-dcl/1 | Version 1 of the [AusDigtial](http://ausdigital.org) [Digital Capability Lookup (DCL)](https://ausdigital-dcl.readthedocs.io) specification
ausdigital-idp/1 | Version 1 of the AusDigital [Identity Provider (IDP)](https://ausdigital-idp.readthedocs.io) specification.
ausdigital-tap/1 | Version 1 of the AusDigital [Transaction Access Point(TAP)](http://ausdigital.org/transaction-access-point) specification.
ausdigital-nry/1 | Version 1 of the AusDigital [Notary (NRY)](http://ausdigital.org/notary/) specification.

The DCP service depends on `ausdigital-dcl/1` and `ausdigital-idp/1`.

Other `ausdigital-tap` and `ausdigital-nry` services both depend on the DCP service.

## Change Process

## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119.


## Application Programming Interface

Implementations MUST provide a compliant REST Application Programming Interface.

A draft [REST interface v1.0](https://swaggerhub.com/api/ausdigital/ausdigital-dcp/1.0) is available for comment.

## Protocol

For open B2B standards to be adopted, users must have confidence in the integrity:

 - confidence in business identity.
 - common business semantics.
 - dynamic service discovery.

This framework operates on the basis that the issuer of a business identifier is best positioned to verify the identity of anyone attempting to authorise an update to the metadata registry. That is why for example we are proposing the ausdigital-dcl/1 for the Australian Business Number (ABN) should be operated by the Australian Business Register (ABR).

The Digital Capability Publisher is functionally equivalent to a REST version of the European OASIS standard "Service Metadata Publisher". Users are expected to have used the ausdigital-dcl/1 to discover the appropriate DCP service for a particular business. They then interact with the DCP using the REST protocol [documented here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/api/ausdigital/ausdigital-dcp/1.0) to access a collection of ServiceMetaData entries for the business. 

The sample below shows a service metadata record example for a business with ABN 23601120601 that supports both standard invoice and RCTI processes.

```
