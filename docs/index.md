## DBC Digital Capability Publisher (DCP) Specification

 * ![raw](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/raw.svg)
 * Editor: Chris Gough
 * Contributors: Steve Capell

This document describes a standard service for discovering the integration surface of a
participant in RESTful business-to-business message exchange.

This specification aims to support the Australian Digital Business Council e-Invoicing
initiative, and is under active development at http://ausdigital.org/.

The DCP service depends on other services:
 * [Digital Capability Locator](https://capability-locator.readthedocs.io)
 * [Identity Provider](https://identity-provider.readthedocs.io)

Other services that depend on the DCP:
 * [Transaction Access Point](http://ausdigital.org/transaction-access-point)
 * [Notary](http://ausdigital.org/notary/)

RFC 2119.


## Application Programming Interface

Implementations MUST provide a compliant REST Application Programming Interface.

A draft [REST interface v1.0](https://swaggerhub.com/api/ausdigital/metadata-publisher/1.0) is available for comment.

## Protocol

For open B2B standards to be adopted, users must have confidence in the integrity:

 - confidence in business identity.
 - common business semantics.
 - dynamic service discovery.

This framework operates on the basis that the issuer of a business identifier is best positioned to verify the identity of anyone attempting to authorise an update to the metadata registry. That is why for example we are proposing the Digital Capability Locator (DCL) for the Australian Business Number (ABN) should be operated by the Australian Business Register (ABR).

The Digital Capability Publisher is functionally equivelent to a REST version of the European OASIS standard "Service Metadata Publisher". Users are expected to have used the Digital Capability Locator [DCL](https://capability-locator.readthedocs.io) to discover the appropriate DCP service for a particular business. They then interact with the DCP using the REST protocol [documented here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/api/ausdigital/metadata-publisher/1.0) to access a collection of ServiceMetaData entries for the business. 

The sample below shows a service metadata record example for a business with ABN 23601120601 that supports both standard invoice and RCTI processes.
