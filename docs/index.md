# Metadata Publisher v1.0 ![draft](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/draft.svg)

The [Ausustralian Digital Business Council](https://https://ausdigital.github.io/) provides open B2B standards for eInvoicing.

These require:

 - confidence in business identity.
 - common business semantics.
 - dynamic service discovery.


Those requirements are met by a component called the [Service Metadata Publisher](/SPEC-metadata-publisher/).

Implementations must provide a compliant interface. The [REST interface v1.0](https://swaggerhub.com/api/ausdigital/metadata-publisher/1.0) is drafted and available for comment.,

This spec is ![draft](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/draft.svg), and is beind developed with the [Consensus Oriented Specification System](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/)
through a [social repository](https://github.com/ausdigital/metadata-publisher). Contributions welcome!

A free reference implementation is available at [https://smp.testpoint.io/](https://smp.testpoint.io/)
